---

Hey ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gabriel. I'm a brazillian programmer, designer, and
activist. Welcome to my little cozy web corner!

## Interests

I'm interested in FLOSS, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, and
Functional Programming. Mainly working with Linux, Rust, Haskell, Postgres,
Nix.

I've been into computers, science and math since I was little. I love Linux,
Free Software, CLI programs, and design.

Outside of computing, I'm a huge fan of space and science fiction genres
(games, books, artwork). Currently reading the Dune book series!

I love animals (I have five cats and a dog), the planet, and the people who
live in it.

## Occupation

I'm about to graduate with a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems degree at
[University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://usp.br)'s [Institute of Mathematics and
Computer Sciences](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/).

I'm currently working at [U-Get](https://br.linkedin.com/company/u-get) as a
DevOps Engineer.

## Tooling

My current tools of choice are: [NixOS](https://nixos.org),
[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io),
[NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org/).
