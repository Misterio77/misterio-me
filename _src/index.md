title: About me
---

Hey ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gabriel. I'm a brazillian programmer, designer, and activist. Welcome to my little web corner!

I'm currently working on my Bachelor of Information Systems degree at [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://usp.br)'s [Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/), as a developer at [UGet](https://br.linkedin.com/company/u-get), and on a couple personal projects.

I'm interested in FLOSS, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, and Functional Programming. Mainly working with Linux, Rust, Postgres, Nix, Python, and C/C++.

## Tech and design

I've been into computers, science and math since I was little. I love Linux, Free Software, CLI programs, and design.

I enjoy working with modern and productive programming languages, strong typing and high performance are always nice to have.

My current tools of choice are: [NixOS](https://nixos.org), [SwayWM](https://swaywm.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io), [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org), [NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org/).

## Other stuff

I'm a huge fan of space and science fiction genres (games, books, artwork).

I love animals (I have five cats and a dog), the planet, and the people who live in it.
