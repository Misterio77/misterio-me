title: About me
---

Hey ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gabriel. I'm a brazilian programmer, designer, and
activist. Welcome to my little cozy web corner!

## Interests

I'm interested in FLOSS, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, and
Functional Programming. Mainly working with Linux, Rust, Haskell, Postgres,
Nix.

I've been into computers, science and math since I was little. I love Linux,
Free Software, CLI programs, and design.

Outside of computing, I'm a huge fan of space and science fiction genres
(games, books, artwork). Currently reading the Dune book series!

I love animals (I have five cats and a dog), the planet, and the people who
live in it.

## Occupation

I'm working towards a Computer Science M.Sc. degree at [University of SÃ£o
Paulo](https://usp.br)'s [Institute of Mathematics and Computer
Sciences](https://icmc.usp.br/en/), under the [Software Engineering
Lab](http://www.labes.icmc.usp.br). My current research is around Software
Engineering topics within Open Source projects. I currently lead our
institute's FLOSS student group, [GELOS](https://gelos.club).

## Tooling

Some of my current tools of choice are: [NixOS](https://nixos.org),
[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io),
[NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org/).
