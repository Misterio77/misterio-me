My interests in computing include free software, distributed systems, software
engineering, reproducibility, DevOps, CI/CD, and development tooling.

I started out with Linux, service hosting, programming, and design as a
teenager, and have never stopped. I currently contribute to a few free software
projects, some of them of my own creation. My technologies of choice nowadays
are Rust, Haskell, Lua, PostgreSQL, Nix(OS), Docker, and Terraform.

Most of my professional experience consists of development processes, build
systems, infrastructure, and backend development. I also have experience with
UI/UX, as well as (web and graphical) design.

I'm currently a Computer Information Systems undergrad student at [University
of São Paulo](https://usp.br), in my final year.

Outside of computing, I enjoy reading (mostly sci-fi), playing the keyboard,
snuggling with my pets, and speaking about things I'm passionate about. I love
learning new things and teaching what I know.

## Education

### Computer Information Systems (2020-2022)

[University of São Paulo](https://usp.br), [Institute of Mathematics and
Computer Sciences](https://icmc.usp.br).

USP is considered to be Brazil's most prestigious university, and is frequently
ranked the top university in latin america.

I've studied different areas in computing, and gained a lot of interpersonal
experience. Subjects I've particularly enjoyed include Software Engineering,
Software Testing, Databases, and Operating Systems.

I'm also one of the founding members and current director at our [Open Source &
Free Software extracurricular group](https://gelos.club).

## Industry experience

### DevOps Engineer (2020-present)

[U-Get](https://uget.express) is a startup that pioneered a computer
vision-based vending machine system. The system is able to recognize and bill
customers based on what they grab from a simple machine (a fridge, for
example), avoiding expensive mechanisms present in traditional vending
machines.

Our team built our systems from the ground up - including mobile apps, fleet
management and billing systems; leveraging Cloud of Things technologies. I
mostly work with automation, databases, and service architecture; I've
championed development cultural changes, making me the person in charge of
CI/CD, version control, and cloud infrastructure. 

### Communication Intern (2020-2020)

[EVAG](https://evag.me). A temporary job during brazillian 2020 municipal
elections, I've built campaign websites for multiple candidates. The job
involved working closely together with the candidates, and making their
requirements into actual websites in a short timespan.

## Open Source Experience

### Flavours

[Flavours](https://github.com/misterio77/flavours) is a command line tool I
created to aid in managing and applying
[base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) color schemes to different
programs a person uses. This allows for consistent theming that can be easily
changed (after setting it up once), and works specially well for software with
text-based configuration files. It is quite popular, with almost 300 stars on
github.

### Nix ecossystem

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a build and deployment tool based on functional
programming concepts, such as immutability. It allows for highly reproducible
packaging, as well as fully declarative Linux systems through
[NixOS](https://nixos.org).

I'm a very active member in the community. Besides contributing with packages
and modules, I've also created a couple relatively popular projects for the
ecossystem:
- [nix-colors](https://github.com/misterio77/nix-colors), a repository of
    nix-accessible base16 color schemes and a module that make their use more
    convenient. It currently has 100+ stars on github.
- [nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/misterio77/nix-starter-configs)
    is a collection of nix repository templates. It aims to provide simple,
    opinionated templates so that people starting out with Nix can hit the
    ground rouning. It currently has 200+ stars on github.
