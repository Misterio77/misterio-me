Hey! Welcome to my website and personal wiki.

## What's this?

If you're here for info about me, visit the [homepage](../index.md). If you're interested
in more polished writing, check the [blog](../blog.html) (if I ever get to write
something better, that is). If you're interested in my personal knowledge and
work-in-progress notes, you're in the right place!

Don't like the colors? Take a look at the [colorscheme](../colorscheme.html) page (not
available on gemini, of course). You can choose any
[base16](https://github.com/base16-project/base16) color scheme you prefer.

### Notes

This section of my website ("notes") is my "second brain", "digital garden",
"personal wiki", or "working notes". As you prefer to call it.

You'll find random notes, class notes, links, work in progress guides, and more
here.

To start browsing, check the [notes homepage](../notes.html). You'll find everything
grouped by tags they belong to.

All notes have backlinking, so just click away!

## Story time

I've come to realize that, right now, most of the stuff I write down is pretty
sparse.

I (recently) started segregating each subject on a different repository and,
while it surely has some advantages (such as different tooling for different
subjects), the fragmentation and difficulty tracking them is a huge drawback. I
have to create a repository, setup PDF building, clone on every computer, for
each and every subject.

I've decided, thus, to re-centralize my notes. This time, in an organized way
that I can publicly display, everything.

## Technical nitty gritty

As you might have realized, I'm using jekyll for the entirety of my
website, including the note section.

The theming and layout was mostly designed by myself, based on
[water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/).

I proudly use [gandi.net](https://gandi.net) for domain and DNS; the awesome
[sourcehut pages](https://srht.site) service for hosting;
[sourcehut builds](https://builds.sr.ht) and [nix](https://nixos.org) for
automating deployments.

The website code is located at [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~misterio/misterio.me)
(also mirrored on [github](https://github.com/misterio77/misterio.me)).

Themes are managed and generated by
[nix-colors](https://github.com/misterio77/nix-colors).

### Gemini?

Gemini is a small web protocol, it is a really cool technology that aims to
create a simpler web. This website has full gemini support (some hand-written,
some automated through [md2gemini](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/md2gemini)).
